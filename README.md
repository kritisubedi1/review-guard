# 🕵️ Review Guard: Fake Review Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Fake Review Detection System** is a locally runnable web application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify online reviews as **genuine** or **fake**.

Users can:

* Analyze a single review text
* Upload a CSV file for batch analysis
* View predictions with confidence percentages
* Run the system fully offline (no cloud required)

This project was developed by a three-person academic team over 10 weeks (part-time, $0 budget).
